This is a [React.js](https://react.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/vercel/React.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://react.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://react.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your react.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=react.js&utm_source=create-react-app&utm_campaign=create-react-app-readme) from the creators of react.js.
